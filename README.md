- A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block (inside curly braces {}) contains one or more declarations, which are the actual styles to be applied.

- A declaration is a property-value pair (e.g., property: value;) that defines a specific style.

- `We will use the font-family property to change the typeface of the text on the page. By applying it to the body, all text elements inside the body (like <h1> and <p>) will inherit this font. It's good practice to provide a "font stack"—a list of fonts separated by commas. The browser will try the first font, and if it's not available, it will try the next one, and so on.`
